A powershell module for communicating with Chia Coin RPC on Windows machines.

In order to use this module you will need to install GIT. The sole purpose of installing GIT is to use OpenSSL.exe that is installed with it. I looked around for the best way to install OpenSSL on Windows and this was by far the easiest and most effective way. This will also put OpenSSL in an expected file location which is also useful.

I will provide a short video on installing GIT when time permits.

All commands were created using the following Chia documentation - https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/RPC-Interfaces. 

Please note that this module is provided as is and makes no gurantees.
